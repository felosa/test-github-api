Observations: 


I decided to use the github api because I wanted to show my logic in a simplistic way. I thought about using the youtube api or spotify api, which would have perhaps made the overall result more visually appealing, but I didn't know if I would have time to do it properly so that is why I decided on using github.

I used React Hooks because I feel it creates a cleaner code, more so than the older version using classes and state. I didn't implement Redux because I think is not neccesary to add that level of complexity in this specific task.

If I could start the project again, I would start implementing Material-UI at the same time as I start the logic. This is because I lost a lot of time changing the HTML after finishing the logic which meant I wasn't as efficient with my time as I needed to be in developing the project as a whole. 

If I were to have more time, I would like to properly implement all of the CSS on my own, using css files, in order to have a cleaner code. I also would have introduced a web responsive design.

I've also attached the link of my project which is deployed in Netlify:
